swayimg (A lightweight image viewer for Wayland display servers)

Swayimg is a lightweight image viewer for Wayland display servers.

In a Sway compatible mode, the viewer creates an overlay above the
currently active window, which gives the illusion that you are opening
the image directly in a terminal window.
